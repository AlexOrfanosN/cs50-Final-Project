#### Description: 
This is Connect Four!
This project, though simplistic and poorly graphically designed, proved to be a big challenge for me. I spent many days and hours trying to figure out what I wanted to do and how to do it. The searching and reading I had to do in the internet alone was maybe half of the workload. 
So what I have here is a very simple connect four game.
 Born in the nineties it was a very dear game to me. I remember when we moved and I lost it. I never could find it again and in time I forgot about it. So I thought, why not make my own game.
There are four files (five including the README.md). To play the game, all you have to do is double click on the index.html and if prompted, open it with a browser of your choosing.
The rules are simple. Two players play against each other. Each player clicks on the column of his/her choice on the board and a chip representing his/her team will appear on the first available slot. Each player tries to win by having four slots next to each other horizontally, vertically or even diagonally.   First player to do so wins. There is an option to restart the game at any point and also when a player wins, a result screen will appear declaring the winner and giving you the option to restart the game and play it again.
The first file is the index.html. Apart from the board and the restart button elements, I decided to put double messages for red and yellow player and two separate result screens, depending who wins the game. Apart from that there is nothing more of interest here.
The second one is the styles.css. Here things got a little tricky for me and I had to read a lot of things on the internet and watch several tutorials to understand how to achieve the things I wanted to do. Initially I only had a black and white board with a white background. Instead of chips there were numbers 1 and 2 (because in the beginning players were called player 1 and player 2). I knew that I wanted thematically to have three colors. Red yellow and blue. The original physical board was blue and the chips were red and yellow so I decided to follow this pattern. 
Originally I made the background red and yellow separated by a diagonal line but I didn’t like it that much so instead I changed it to a gradient color keeping the red and yellow. Its softer and gives it, in my opinion, a more professional look. 
After that It was time for the board. I tried a lot to make it seem like the original board but I could not figure it out. 
I changed the chips into red and yellow dots instead of 1 and 2. I tried very much to add a falling effect of the chips in the board but I was not able to figure it out.
Next i wanted to display a message for each players turn. The reason why I put two separate messages in the html file was because I wanted a different color and position of the message depending on whose player’s turn was.
I opted for the same solution for the result screen element.
Finally I gave the restart button of the result screen and the permanent one a bright blue color.
After that we have the app.js file. Originally I tried to handle the logic of the game with python but I encountered problems so I changed to javascript. This alone took very much time because I was not at all familiar with js. I had to watch a lot of tutorials to manage to do this.
Finally I added a favicon.ico to add a little style.
It was difficult and still it ended up looking very simplistic but still, when my roommate and i started playing the finished game, I got a sense of accomplishment and joy that I could not imagine. I learned a lot of things from this project and I intend to keep making new projects. I think that the process of researching what you need to do for each different project makes you more knowledgeable than reading in general.
